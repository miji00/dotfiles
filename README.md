### Configuration is still in progress.

# ***TODO***
1. tmux
   1. Tmux currently launches automatically whenever Alacritty runs, making it difficult to choose between attaching to an existing session or creating a new one.
   2. The <kbd>$MOD+Q</kbd> shortcut closes the terminal window visually, but the Tmux session continues running in the background.
   3. Evaluate [tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer) by ThePrimeagen for managing sessions.
   4. The `.tmux.conf` file is incomplete; only a few lines have been written so far.
